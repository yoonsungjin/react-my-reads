# MyReads 

This is the book collection app that keep track of book history. You can seperate each book on one of shelf - Currently reading, Read and Want to Read. You can also search a book and move to the shelf where you want. Any status of book shelf will be stored in database using `BooksAPI` therefore when you refresh the page or come back later, you always see the same status of book shelf. 

# Get Started
## Installation
```sh
$ git clone
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
